# First steps
## Generating data set:
  ### Covariates:
  -> large number of covariates relative to n \
  -> let covariates be correlated (generate covariate covariance matrix) \
  -> interact them? (see Jacob (2021) \
  -> All from a standard normal distribution? \
  
  ### Treatment assignment:
  -> Exogeneous treatment assignment, bernoulli distributed \
  
  ### Treatment effects:
  -> Do as Jacob (2021): 2 approaches, one with a linear relationship between covariates and the CATE and another with a non-linear relationship \
