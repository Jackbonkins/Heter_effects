Main files overview:
-------------------------------------- 
Only executing the **.ipynb** files are required to get the figures/tables from the paper. The **.py** scripts are mostly functions and methods that are then used in the jupyter notebooks.

The RMSE Files folder includes the .pkl files to replicate the main RMSE figures in the thesis.
